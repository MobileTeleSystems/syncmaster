0.2.2 (2025-04-11)
==================

Breaking
--------

- Use ``PUT /v1/qroups/:id`` instead of ``PATCH /v1/qroups/:id``.
- Use ``PUT /v1/qroups/:id/users/:id`` instead of ``PATCH /v1/qroups/:id/users/:id``.
- Use ``PUT /v1/queues/:id`` instead of ``PATCH /v1/queues/:id``.
- Now allowed names length should be in 3..128 symbols range, not 1..inf.

Improvements
------------

- Now queue name can include any ASCII printable characters.
- Queue slug is always lowercase. Spaces, hyphens and underscores are replaced with ``-`` symbol.

Bug fixes
---------

- Call ``kinit`` before starting Spark session conecting to ``Hive`` cluster. (:issue:`225`)
- Fix ``HDFS`` connection was trying to use anonymous auth instead of user/password. (:issue:`225`)
- Fix updating queue ignored name and didn't reset description.
