## Breaking Changes

- Implement a single error handling format to improve consistency ([#95](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/95))
- Change response format for `GET /v1/groups` - add **current user role** for each group ([#97](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/97))
- Change response format for `GET /v1/groups/:id` - add **current user role** for group ([#109](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/109))
- Now migrations are executed in a dedicated one-off container, instead of being run as a part of `backend` container. ([#163](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/163))
- Delete **transfers**, **queues** and **groups** records instead of marking them as deleted ([#168](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/168))
- Move the `type` field from nested `connection_data` field to the root level of the `Connection` response. ([#169](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/169))
- Decouple `auth_data.type` from the connection type (e.g. `postgres`) and link it to the authentication type (e.g. `basic`). ([#169](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/169))
- Add deletion of **connections** records instead of marking them as deleted ([#170](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/170))
- Use PUT instead of PATCH for `Connection` and `Transfer` models ([#215](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/215))
- Return new connection and transfer object in `POST /v1/transfer/copy` and `POST /v1/connection/copy` endpoints.
- Change response status from 200 to 204 for all `DELETE` endpoints.

## Improvements

- Updated `User` model to include `email`, `first_name`, `middle_name`, and `last_name` fields, all optional. ([#123](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/123))
- Read env variable `SYNCMASTER__ENTRYPOINT__SUPERUSERS` to promote users to `SUPERUSER` role during server startup. ([#137](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/137))
- Enabled dynamic selection of authentication provider via environment variable `SYNCMASTER__AUTH__PROVIDER`. ([#123](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/123))
- Enable parallel reading from JDBC sources. ([#219](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/219))
- Reset HWM when changing strategy from `incremental` to `full`. ([#217](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/217))
- Grant read-only permissions for the previous group owner when ownership is transferred ([#135](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/135))

## Bug Fixes

- Use Hadoop AWS `magic` commiter only if transfer *target* is S3. ([#46](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/46))
- Check that `service_name` and `sid` are mutually exclusive when editing Oracle connection. ([#52](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/52))
- Queue name is unique within a group, new field `slug` is globally-unique. ([#54](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/54), [#119](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/119))
- Prohibit updating connection type it if there is a transfer associated with this connection. ([#55](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/55))
- Fix error when `is_scheduled` field value was ignored. ([#57](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/57))
- Group without any users assigned was missing in groups list. ([#62](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/62))
- Dump connection credentials while starting a transfer. ([#63](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/63))
