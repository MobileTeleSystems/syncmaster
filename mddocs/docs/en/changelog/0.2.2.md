# 0.2.2 (2025-04-11) { #0.2.2 }

## Breaking

- Use `PUT /v1/qroups/:id` instead of `PATCH /v1/qroups/:id`.
- Use `PUT /v1/qroups/:id/users/:id` instead of `PATCH /v1/qroups/:id/users/:id`.
- Use `PUT /v1/queues/:id` instead of `PATCH /v1/queues/:id`.
- Now allowed names length should be in 3..128 symbols range, not 1..inf.

## Improvements

- Now queue name can include any ASCII printable characters.
- Queue slug is always lowercase. Spaces, hyphens and underscores are replaced with `-` symbol.

## Bug fixes

- Call `kinit` before starting Spark session conecting to `Hive` cluster. ([#225](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/225))
- Fix `HDFS` connection was trying to use anonymous auth instead of user/password. ([#225](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/syncmaster/issues/225))
- Fix updating queue ignored name and didn’t reset description.
